## Features
### Planned
* Define weekdays to operate, similar to Wyze behaviors.
* Define time range to operate within (i.e. May 10th to September 30th), then sleep until next year.
* Fine control over cycling patterns (i.e. "in time frame 5am-9am, run )

## Introduction
Currently, the Wyze app offers little in the way of creating custom fan-only schedules and is limited to cycling the fan X amount of minutes for every hour of the day. On warmer days, homeowners without air conditioning may want to run their furnace fans in the mornings/evenings only yet have no way to automate this behavior.

While others have found success using Home Assistant running on Raspberry Pi, they are [limited to Raspberry Pi 3 or above](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/raspberrypi/).

better_wyze_fan aims to give homeowners the control they want, all while being lightweight enough to run on boards such as Raspberry Pi Zero W.
